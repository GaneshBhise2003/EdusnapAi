This video discusses how to design a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for variations of a previously discussed problem.  The core problem involves strings where the number of 'a's is a multiple of three and the number of 'b's is a multiple of two.  The video explores modifying the acceptance criteria using modulo operations.

Different examples are presented, changing the conditions for acceptance. For instance, requiring the number of 'a's modulo 3 to be greater than or equal to one, and the number of 'b's modulo 2 to be equal to zero.  This changes which states in the DFA are considered final/accepting states. The video explains how to identify these final states based on the given conditions.

The video further demonstrates scenarios with stricter inequalities (greater than) and explores cases where conflicting conditions result in an empty language (no strings accepted).  Finally, it emphasizes that regardless of the specific conditions (greater than, less than, equal to), the total number of states in the DFA remains constant (six in this case, due to 3 x 2 possible modulo combinations), and the final states are determined based on the given constraints.
