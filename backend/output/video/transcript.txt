 so in this video same question previous video we discussed earlier we will explain how to frame the question in different ways so this diagram number of a is multiple of 3 and number of b if the question is framed number of a is greater than 1 greater than 1 and number of b is equal to 0 so how we design this we will design the same we will design this according to this given diagram we will change this string if we will count the number of a in this string and we will take out the mod value of the mod value is equal to 0, 1 and 2 so this result is equal to 0 number of b mod 2 is equal to 0 so what is the state of mod 1, 0 and 2 so what will we do this is the final state but this is the final state we will see this is the final state and this is the final state and this is the final state okay? the other the other is the non-final this is not the final so this is the condition the number of a mod 3 is greater than or equal to 1 so if we see the remainder of the mod then this is the condition that is equal to 0 and greater or less is not the condition so 1 and 2 so this is the condition of the remainder of the mod and this is the remainder of the mod so this is the state next is the remainder because the first is the first and the second is the remainder and the second is the second so what will happen here here this is greater than equal to 1 but sorry this is equal to 1 but this is 0 not the case the question should be 0 and the second is the greater than equal to 1 but this is 0 not the case this is greater than equal to this condition is not the case if this condition is the same simply greater than equal to 1 if this condition is the same number of a mod 3 is greater than strictly greater than 1 so this is the first and the first is 0 if this is the remainder is 0, 1 and 2 so is this greater than equal to 1 no is this greater than equal to 1 yes and this is the final because this is greater than equal to 1 and this remainder as it is the same so this is the example or this problem according to DFA now what is the question is strictly greater than equal to 1 and what is here is greater than 1 okay so if you see greater than equal to 1 then this is just DFA but what is this value or 0 so this is the question so what will happen next why it can't happen because greater than equal to 1 is greater than 1 or 0 or 1 so this is the according so if this problem is then no final state then the condition will be satisfied so this is the whole thing that will be non-final state so the language will be your file okay next if this is the change is the change greater than equal to 0 and greater than equal to 0 if this is the question number of A W mod 3 is strictly greater than 0 and number of B is 0 so what was the difference 0, 1, and 2 so what was the difference so if this is strictly greater than 0 then what is the difference 1 and 2 is strictly greater than 0 then what is your any 1, 1 and 2, 1 so where is 1, 1 and where is your final state and where is your non-final state so the question is greater than equal to total number of states mod 3 and mod 2 so how much will the total state be 6 because what will be the combination of this 0, 1, 2, and remainder and 0 and 1 so if we will draw the state and define the transition then give some information greater than or less than equal to the same according to the final state
