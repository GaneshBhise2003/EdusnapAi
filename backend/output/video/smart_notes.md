### Initial Problem & Modification (00:00:00)
* **Problem**: Design a DFA where the number of 'a's is a multiple of 3 and the number of 'b's is a multiple of 2.
* **Modification**: Number of 'a's mod 3 is greater than or equal to 1, and the number of 'b's mod 2 is equal to 0.
* **Approach**: Modify the original DFA's final states based on the new conditions.
* **Final States**: 10 and 20 (representing remainders after mod operations).

### Explanation of the Modification (00:00:30)
* **Mod Values**: 'a' mod 3 results in 0, 1, or 2; 'b' mod 2 results in 0 or 1.
* **Condition 1**: Number of 'a's mod 3 >= 1, meaning the remainder can be 1 or 2.
* **Condition 2**: Number of 'b's mod 2 = 0, meaning the remainder must be 0.
* **State Representation**: States are represented as two digits (e.g., 10), where the first digit is the remainder of 'a's count divided by 3, and the second is the remainder of 'b's count divided by 2.

### Further Modifications and Examples (00:01:30)
* **Strict Inequality**: If the condition for 'a's is strictly greater than 1 (mod 3 > 1), only state 20 would be final.
* **Impossible Condition**: If the condition for 'b's is mod 2 > 1, no final state exists, resulting in an empty language (Î¦).
* **Another Example**: If the conditions are mod 3 > 0 for 'a's and mod 2 > 0 for 'b's, the final states would be 11 and 21.

### General Approach and Conclusion (00:03:00)
* **State Generation**: Total states are determined by the product of the mod values (3 x 2 = 6 in this case).
* **Transition Definition**: Transitions remain the same as the original DFA.
* **Final State Selection**: Final states are chosen based on the given conditions (>, <, =).
* **Flexibility**: This approach can handle various combinations of conditions on the number of 'a's and 'b's.
